# JavaScript Comments
* JavaScript comments are hints that a programmer can add to make their code easier to read and understand. 
* They are completely ignored by JavaScript engines.

# There are two ways to add comments to code:

// - Single Line Comments
/* */ -Multi-line Comments

# Single Line Comments

* In JavaScript, any line that starts with // is a single line comment.
```js
name = "ram";

// printing name on the console
console.log("Hello " + name);

```

// printing name on the console is a comment

# Multi-line Comments

* In Javascript, any text between /* and */ is a multi-line comment

```js
/* The following program contains the source code for 

For the they cannot move. The player controlling the his disposal.
*/
```
